# Divine Origin of Man
#### April 04, 1970
## President Joseph Fielding Smith

My beloved brethen and sisters: I am grateful beyond any measure of expression for the blessings the Lord has given to me, and to the faithful members of his church in the various nations of the earth, and to all his children everywhere.

I thank him every day of my life that he has restored in these last days his everlasting gospel for the salvation of all who will believe and obey its laws.

### President David O. McKay

I thank him for the life and ministry of each of the good and great men whom he has called to govern and direct the affairs of his latter-day kingdom.

May I say in particular how much we miss President David O. McKay. As we all know, he was a man of great spiritual strength, a natural-born leader of men, and a man beloved by his people and honored by the world. For all time to come men shall rise up and call his name blessed.

President McKay reminded us often that our mission is to all the world -- for the peace, and hope, and happiness, and temporal and eternal salvation of all of our Father's children.

He extended educational opportunities to many peoples in many countries -- to Hawaii, the South Pacific, Latin America, and widely among the American Indians. In his remarkable and wide-ranging administration, he sought to bless the people of all the world, so far as possible.

And I say to you, my beloved brethren and sisters, that I know the Lord was pleased with the broad, far-seeing administration of President McKay, and with all my powers of persuasion I urge this people to continue to reach out and bless the lives of all our Father's children everywhere.

### Relationship of good will

May I say how pleased we are as a people for the increased understanding and for the kindly relationship which we enjoy with other faiths, and I trust and pray that this wholesome relationship of goodwill and Christian fellowship will increase and will bless the lives of all who are touched by it.

I think if all men knew and understood who they are, and were aware of the divine source from whence they came, and of the infinite potential that is part of their inheritance, they would have feelings of kindness and kinship for each other that would change their whole way of living and bring peace on earth.

### Divine origin of man

We believe in the dignity and divine origin of man. Our faith is founded on the fact that God is our Father, and that we are his children, and that all men are brothers and sisters in the same eternal family.

As members of his family, we dwelt with him before the foundations of this earth were laid, and he ordained and established the plan of salvation whereby we gained the privilege of advancing and progressing as we are endeavoring to do.

The God we worship is a glorified Being in whom all power and perfection dwell, and he has created man in his own image and likeness, with those characteristics and attributes which he himself possesses.

And so our belief in the dignity and destiny of man is an essential part both of our theology and of our way of life. It is the very basis of our Lord's teaching that "the first and great commandment" is: "Thou shalt love the Lord they God with all thy heart, and with all they soul, and with all they mind"; and that the second great commandment is: "Thou shalt love they neighbour as theyself." (See Matt:37-39.)

### Love of God and fellowman

Because God is our Father, we have a natural desire to love and serve him and to be worthy members of his family. We feel an obligation to do that he would have us do, to keep his commandments and live in harmony with the standards of his gospel -- all of which are essential parts of true worship.

And because all men are our brothers, we have a desire to love and bless and fellowhsip them -- and this too we accept as an essential part of true worship.

Thus everything we do in the Church centers around the divine law that we are to love and worship God and serve our fellowmen.

It is no wonder, then, that as a church and as a people we have deep and abiding concern for the welfare of all our Father's children. We seek their temporal and spiritual well-being along with our own. We pray for them as we do for ourselves, and we try to live so that they, seeing our good works, may be led to glorify our Father whoe is in heaven.
