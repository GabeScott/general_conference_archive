President Joseph Fielding Smith

â€¢ My dear brethren and sisters: As we

conclude another great conference of

the Church, I desire to leave my blessings upon you.

The power to bless

The priesthood is the power to bless

mankind, and all of those who hold

the priesthood are expected to use it

within the sphere of their assignment

to bless their fellowmen. When any

of us use this authority in righteousness, and as directed by the Holy Spirit,

our acts are binding and will be recognized by the Lord both in time and in

eternity.

And so I feel to bless the saints,

all those who love the Lord and who

signify their devotion to his cause

by keeping his commandments. I wish

to bless them temporally and spiritually and pray God our Father to pour out

his bounties upon them so they may

be prospered in all their righteous endeavors.

Gratitude for blessings

I speak for myself and for all of you

and pour out my soul in thanksgiving

to the Lord for all he has so bounteously bestowed upon us.

We have been set up as a free people

by the power of our Eternal Father.

The beauties and bounties of nature

are ours, and we have these truths by

obedience to which we can live lives

that will be pleasing in his sight, that

will give us peace and joy in this life,

and assure us of an eternal and abundant life with him in his everlasting

kingdom.

Prayer

I feel to say, O our Eternal Father,

pour out thy Spirit more abundantly

upon these thy saints, upon this remnant of scattered Israel which has

gathered to thy gospel in these last days.

Thou knowest that as a people we

desire to serve thee, to keep the commandments, and to carry thy message

of truth and righteousness to thy people

everywhere. For this reason we send

our missionaries to every part of the

world. I have had my sons in the

mission field constantly for many years.

One is in the mission field at this present time in a foreign country, where

he has been for several years.

We thank thee, our Father, for the

great outpouring of truth and light that

has come from the lips of thy servants

at this conference, and which has been

carried into the hearts of honest men

everywhere by the power of thy Holy

Spirit.

We thank thee that we have been

fed the bread of life, that we have been

strengthened spiritually and are now

renewed and refreshed and ready to

go forth on thy errand, doing to the

best of our abilities those things which

thou wouldst have us do.

Our Father in heaven, we are grateful for all thou hast given us; we

acknowledge thy hand in all things,

and we pray for the success and triumph of thy purposes in all the earth.

We know that thou hast spoken in

this day as thou didst in days of old,

and we are pleased to be instruments

in thy hands of carrying thy message

to the world, and of standing as lights

to the world so that they, seeing our

good works, may be led to glorify thee.

And unto thy holy name we ascribe

the honor and glory in all things both

now and forever.

In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen. q
