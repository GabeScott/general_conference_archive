President Joseph Fielding Smith

â€¢ My dear brethren of the priesthood:

I welcome this opportunity to speak

to the priesthood holders who are

gathered in many places throughout

the Church.

I desire to call your attention to the

oath and covenant of the Melchizedek

Priesthood. I think if we have a clear

understanding of the covenant we make

when we receive offices in the priesthood, and of the promise the Lord gives

if we magnify our callings, then we

shall have a greater incentive to do

all the things we must do to gain

eternal life.

May I say further that everything

connected with this higher priesthood is

designed and intended to prepare us to

gain eternal life in the kingdom of

God.

Revelation on priesthood

In the revelation on priesthood, given

to Joseph Smith in September 1832, the

Lord says that the Melchizedek Priesthood is everlasting; that it administers

the gospel, is found in the true church

in all generations, and holds the keys

of the knowledge of God. He says that

it enables the Lord's people to be sanctified, to see the face of God, and to

enter into the rest of the Lord, "which

rest is the fulness of his glory." (See

D&C 84:17-24.)

Then, speaking of both the Aaronic

and Melchizedek priesthoods, the Lord

says: "For whoso is faithful unto the

obtaining these two priesthoods of

which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the

Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.

"They become the sons of Moses and

of Aaron and the seed of Abraham,

and the church and kingdom, and the

elect of God.

"And also all they who receive this

priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;

"For he that receiveth my servants

receiveth me;

"And he that receiveth me receiveth

my Father;

"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore

all that my Father hath shall be given

unto him.

"And this is according to the oath

and covenant which belongeth to the

priesthood.

"Therefore, all those who receive the

priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot

break, neither can it be moved."

The penalty for breaking the covenant and altogether turning therefrom

is then given, together with this commandment: ". . . beware concerning

yourselves, to give diligent heed to the

words of eternal life.

"For you shall live by every word

that proceedeth forth from the mouth

of God." (D&C 84:33-44.)

Gospel covenants

As all of us know, a covenant is a

contract and an agreement between

at least two parties. In the case of

gospel covenants, the parties are the

Lord in heaven and men on earth.

Men agree to keep the commandments

and the Lord promises to reward them

accordingly. The gospel itself is the

new and everlasting covenant and embraces all of the agreements, promises,

and rewards which the Lord offers to

his people.

And so when we receive the Melchizedek Priesthood we do so by covenant. We solemnly promise to receive

the priesthood, to magnify our callings

in it, and to live by every word that

proceedeth forth from the mouth of

God. The Lord on his part promises

us that if we keep the covenant, we

shall receive all that the Father hath,

which is life eternal. Can any of us

conceive of a greater or more glorious

agreement than this?

Magnifying our callings

Sometimes we speak loosely of magnifying our priesthood, but what the

revelations speak of is magnifying our

callings in the priesthood, as elders,

seventies, high priests, patriarchs, and

apostles.

The priesthood held by man is the

power and authority of God delegated

to man on earth to act in all things

for the salvation of mankind. Priesthood offices or callings are ministerial

assignments to perform specially assigned service in the priesthood. And

the way to magnify these callings is

to do the work designed to be performed by those who hold the particular office involved.

It does not matter what office we

hold as long as we are true and faithful

to our obligations. One office is not

greater than another, although for administrative reasons one priesthood

holder may be called to preside over

and direct the labors of another.

Authority from priesthood

My father, President Joseph F. Smith,

said: "There is no office growing out

of this priesthood that is or can be

greater than the priesthood itself. It is

from the priesthood that the office derives its authority and power. No office

gives authority to the priesthood. No

office adds to the power of the priesthood. But all offices in the Church

derive their power, their virtue, their

authority, from the priesthood."

We are called upon to magnify our

callings in the priesthood and to do the

work which goes with the office we

receive. And so the Lord says, in the

revelation on priesthood: "Therefore,

let every man stand in his own office,

and labor in his own calling; . . . that

the system may be kept perfect." (D&C

84:109-10.)

This is one of the great goals toward

which we are working in the priesthood

program of the Church, to have elders

do the work of elders, seventies the

work of seventies, high priests the work

of high priests, and so on, so that all

priesthood holders may magnify their

own callings and reap the rich blessings promised from such a course.

Oath of priesthood

Now may I say a few words about

the oath which accompanies the reception of the Melchizedek Priesthood.

To swear with an oath is the most

solemn and binding form of speech

known to the human tongue; and it

was this type of language which the

Father chose to have used in the great

Messianic prophecy about Christ and

the priesthood. Of him it says: "The

Lord hath sworn, and will not repent,

Thou are a priest for ever after the

order of Melchizedek." (Ps. 110:4.)

In explaining this Messianic prophecy, Paul says that Jesus had "an

unchangeable priesthood," and that

through it came "the power of an endless life." (See Heb. 7:24, 16.) Joseph

Smith said that "all those who are ordained unto this priesthood are made

like unto the Son of God, abiding a

priest continually," that is, if they are

faithful and true.

And so Christ is the great prototype

where priesthood is concerned, as he is

with reference to baptism and all other

things. And so, even as the Father

swears with an oath that his Son shall

inherit all things through the priesthood, so he swears with an oath that

all of us who magnify our callings in

that same priesthood shall receive all

that the Father hath.

Promise of exaltation

This is the promise of exaltation offered to every man who holds the

Melchizedek Priesthood, but it is a conditional promise, a promise conditioned

upon our magnifying our callings in

the priesthood and living by every word

that proceedeth forth from the mouth

of God.

It is perfectly clear that there are no

more glorious promises that have or

could be made than those that came to

us when we accepted the privilege and

assumed the responsibility of holding

the holy priesthood and of standing as

ministers of Christ.

The Aaronic Priesthood is a preparatory priesthood to qualify us to make

the covenant and receive the oath that

attends this higher priesthood.

It is my prayer that all of us who

have been called to represent the Lord

and hold his authority may remember

who we are and act accordingly.

Gratitude for priesthood

May I conclude by saying how grateful I am that I hold the holy priesthood. I have sought all my days to

magnify my calling in that priesthood

and hope to endure to the end in this

life and to enjoy the fellowship of the

faithful saints in the life to come.

I bear my testimony that we do in

fact have the holy priesthood, that it

is God's power, and that through it we

may inherit the fullness of our Father's

kingdom hereafter, in the name of

Jesus Christ. Amen. O
