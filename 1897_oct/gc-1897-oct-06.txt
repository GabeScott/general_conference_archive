ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH.
Necessity of a strict observance of the Sabbath.
—
Permissable enjoyment and recreatien on week
days.— Effects of Sabbath-breaking upon our
children.
I am happy in the opportunity of
listening, as I did this forenoon, to the
remarks that were made by our brethren who spoke to us; and I was especially pleased that President Woodruff was enabled to be here and open
this Conference by speaking for a short
period of time. I trust that during the
time I may occupy, I may be permitted
to enjoy the same spirit that was enjoyed by our brethren in their conversations this morning. I have no subject upon my mind at this moment, but
I trust that the suggestions of the
Spirit .may point out the direction in
which I should go, that I may be enabled to touch upon some subject or
other that shall be of interest to you.
During the past few months, in visiting the stake conferences and also in
attending meetings in various wards, I
have been very strongly impressed
with the necessity for a much more
strict observance of the Sabbath day
than the Saints have been giving to it,
and in talking to the people I have
been more impressed to speak upon
that matter than upon any other.
No people in the world have been
dealt more generously with in the line
of enjoyment—proper enjoyment—than
the Latter-day Saints. Other religious
peoples take little of those lighter enjoyments, and seem to regard them as
sinful. But to us the Lord has been
generous, in that we have been permitted to enjoy ourselves in witnessing
representations upon the "mimic
stage," to also have some pleasure in
parties, and to enjoy ourselves in dancing. A great many religious people regard these representations upon the
stage, also dancing, as improper and
wrong; but I myself am most happy
in the thought that our Heavenly
Father, in the introducing of His work
and in seeking to establish among His
children a correct understanding of the
obligations and requirements of life,
has permitted us the opportunity of
lightening our minds, changing our
currents of thought, and devoting ourselves to reasonable and proper amusements, that the mind might be freed
from its constant load or strain occasioned by its so continuously pursuing the directions of those weightier
conditions and obligations, and the
continuance of thought upon them, by
which the mind becomes overcharged
and, as a result, produces sickness and
feebleness, without there is some way
in which it can be relieved. To my
mind, the spirit and feeling and sentiment engendered in legitimate and proper amusements produces a most
pleasing and satisfactory effect and result upon the mind that is thus permitted to throw off its weightier
thoughts and enter upon legitimate
and proper amusements, freeing it
and enabling it to carry its weightier
burdens more easily and more fully
and mdre thoroughly.
But I notice that while this spirit of
amusement is legitimate and proper in
the sphere of our every-day life, the
tendency seems to be growing among
many to disregard the Sabbath day
and to change it from the day of worship, the day of rest, the day upon
which we may be enabled to commune
with our own thoughts and to reach
out after the inspiration of the Spirit
of God—that tendency, I say, is a
growing one, to change that day into
a day of pleasure; and to my mind, as
I look around and note that tendency,
I am sanguine that it is not for the
best, but, upon the contrary, that, unless proper means shall be adopted to
change this tendency, the sacred character of that day and the obligation
that rests upon us as the children of
our Heavenly Father to worship Him,
is going to result badly; and it looks
to me that an earnest effort should be
made by the Elders of the Church to
more deeply impress upon the minds of
those of middle age and upon the
younger and growing generations, the

sacredness of that day. There is no
reason that can be assigned among the
Latter-day Saints why it should be
turned into a day of pleasure-seeking,
a day of recreation.
The opportunities given in which we
can enjoy ourselves with propriety in
our social gatherings during the week
should be appreciated by us; and while
we may be required to labor, our time
being largely utilized in the various
employments upon which we enter in
order to obtain our livelihood, these op-
' portunities for recreation present themselves continuously before us. I feel
in connection with this matter that we
need—and we need it very badly too,
taken as a whole—to have the entire
time that comes as the Sabbath day to
devote our minds and our hearts to
communion with that Spirit that comes
from on high. Laboring and struggling daily and hourly to meet the
physical needs of man, or to gratify
some desire in the line of amusement,
our minds are taken away from that
regard and respect to the Sabbath day,
and that regard and reverence and respect to the requirements of our Heavenly Father in connection with the
softening of our minds and putting
our spirits in touch with Him, that
the tendency to simply go to Sabbath
school or to attend one service upon
the Sabbath day, either in the Tabernacle or in the ward meeting houses,or
other buildings, and then to
hitch up our teams and drive
about the city, or into the
canyons, or to be found following
up the streams and fishing, and indulging in these species of recreation,
to my mind is not in keeping with the
spirit and nature of the work the Lord
has set us to do. I believe that so far
as may be practicable, our animals
should have the same opportunites for
rest upon the Sabbath day that we
have. It is true that there may be
circumstances arising, in order to discharge the legitimate and proper duties that rest upon us, that we may
be compelled to drive our teams, or
that we may be compelled, through
sickness or otherwise, to be found not
performing in its strictness the
duties attendant upon us as members
of the body of Christ; but with the
generous opportunities that have been
given to us for amusement, the chance
that is ours to change our current of thought, and the requirement laid upon our Father's children,
not alone in the ages that have gone
by, but in these days that they should
remember the Sabbath day and keep
it holy, we can avoid these evils.
Again in this dispensation, the Lord
has renewed His covenant with His
children, and pointed out to them the
course they should pursue in regard to
His work. Yet day by day or Sabbath
by Sabbath, in mingling among the
people, in noting the conditions that
arise, as the tendency to the violation
of the Sabbath and to disregard the
sacredness of that holy day increases,
I see that infidelity will increase, because to indulge upon that day in the
same species of labor or careless
amusement common upon other days,
and to neglect and disregard the obligations we owe to that day rendered
sacred by our Father in Heaven, upon
which we should approach Him, will
increase the spirit of disregard for
our Heavenly Father in the breasts of
those who indulge in it. I do not wish,
in any sense, to become cranky, as we
sometimes say of our brethren who
strike upon a hobby and seem to work
at it continuously, but, to my mind,
there has grown to be a reckless disregard of that sacred requirement of
holding holy and sacred the Sabbath
day, in the minds of a great body of
people who profess to be Latter-day
Saints. It is not confined to the
boys and girls who drift away from
the restraints that should exist in the
home, but it is manifest among those
of more mature years. It is seen in
many places and under many conditions, and it is repeated Sabbath after
Sabbath, from month's end to month's
end, and from year's end to year's end,
and I trust that the faith and respect
and reverence that should be shown in
connection with the sacred observance
of that day, devoted by our Heavenly
Father to the enlightenment and uplifting of His children in the knowledge
of Himself, shall not be held so lightly
as it seems to be growing to be in the
minds of many people who profess to
believe upon His name, but that,
wherever it may be possible, they will
obey His wish, and hold sacred His
day, that with themselves and their
households, they will attend the ser-

vices of the Church, and, if unable so tc
do, within the sacred folds of their
own home circle will study the
scriotures and seek to impress upon
their minds a knowledge of His purposes, as shown in the sacred things
which have come to us.
I feel that in connection with this
matter, a change should take place
with us; and while we may not
be enabled to avoid some seeming violations of that sacred day,
I believe that the spirit of every
member of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Later-day Saints should be
directed to a more careful and
thoughtful and prudent observance
of the obligations which attach to us
in connection with that day; that those
teams and our vehicles, that those
that are dependent upon us, shall be
made to feel and sense the saeredness
of that day and their duty to their
Maker; that their minds may be
eased of the strain of their week-day
labor, and have communion with the
Holy Spirit, that spirit that brings
joy and gladness, that awakens hope,
that puts us in sacred touch with our
Heavenly Father, and renders us
obedient to His holy wish,—that that
spirit may be with them and direct
and guide them into its strict observance. I believe that carriage riding
and buggy riding in this city and in
these larger cities among the Saints,
has grown to be a crime, and that our
Heavenly Father is not pleased with
it. That is my spirit and feeling in
regard to that matter. President Cannon asks, "What about bicycles?"
Well, I say this, my brethren and sisters, in regard to this question of riding of horses and bicycles, the driving of teams, and such like upon the
Sabbath day: I recognize that many
are so situated, being miles away
from places of worship, that they
must of necessity drive their teams
in order to take their families to their
legitimate and proper places of worship,—I have nothing to say with
reference to this matter, but when 6ur
teams are hitched up every Sabbath
afternoon and driven for hours and
hotirs for pleasure, I think we trench
upfon ground upon which we should
not enter. I think, brethren and
Sisters. remembering the goodness df our Father to us, that while
the rest of the religious world feel
that it is a crime upon their part to
have social enjoyments, our Father
has permitted us to have these, going
upon the basis that reasonable pleasure is legitimate and right, and drawing our minds from the weighty loads
that come to men and women in their
struggle of life; but O, let us hold
sacred that day that our Father has
named as the day upon which we, as
His children, taught in the principles
of righteousness, should show our love
for Him, and our love for the principles involved in good government, in
the balancing and shaping of the mind
in its currents of thought along
religious channels, and not be in a
condition that our minds shall be
given wholly to the enjoyment or pursuit of pleasure alone, or to the
weighty obligations of life, to the
business affairs of life, that drift us
away from the sacred communion of
the Holy Spirit.
My brethren and sisters, I ask that
you who are under the sound of my
voice this day will bear in remembrance that God has decreed that the
Sabbath day should be held sacred
and holy in His sight, and He expects
us, His sons and His daughters, to so
regard it in our ministrations and
labors, to only discharge such duties
as rest upon us, that are impossible
for us to avoid but which come
legitimately and cannot be avoided.
My witness to you is that they who
remember the Sabbath day, who shall
take the rest proposed in the change
of thought, who shall do it in attendance upon the sacred service,
where the worship of God is present,
will live longer lives, will be made
more acceptable in every respect to
our Heavenly Father; and in their
children and their children's children
will the impress of that spirit to hold
sacred the day of rest and worship
be manifest in their lives, which will
bring joy and satisfaction to the
fathers and mothers because of the
course that they pursue.
I pray that the Spirit of the Lord
may indeed be in our midst, that the
determination shall be a fixed and established one that in the homes of
the Latter-day Saints, wherever they
may be situated.shall be found a people
who revere and respect the sacred day
which God has designated as a day of

rest, that that day shall not become
a day of pleasure but, upon the contrary, a day of worship, of reverence,
and love for the Supreme Being, and
that each one will seek to do his
Father's bidding in this respect, and
keep His commandments. Amen.
