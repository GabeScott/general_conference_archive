ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.
Endorsement of the Conference proceedings
â€”
Testimony of the Truth.
My brethren and sisters, I have been
exceedingly happy during this Conference, and, with you, have enjoyed the
blessings thereof, and my heart is
filled with gratitude for this great
privilege of being numbered with the
Church of Christ, Avith having a name
and a standing in the Church. I have
rejoiced exceedingly in the outpourings
of the Spirit of the Lord upon His servants, and their words and utterances and their actions have had a
response in my heart, and the Spirit of
the Lord has testified to my spirit that
all that hath been done is of the Lord,
and with my whole soul I accept the
counsels and instructions that have
been imparted to us.
I desire to bear my testimony not
only to those truths that we have received during this Conference, but to
the truth of the work of the Lord. I
rejoice that through His grace the
truth of this work hath been made
known unto me. I have said to some
of my intimate friends that I think it
is a good thing that the Lord has made
it known to me, for if He had not made
it known beyond all doubt, it is very
questionable with me if I could believe
it. But I have received that testimony

and am pleased with the opportunity
of saying- so once more to you, and I
desire to live in harmony with it, and
be saved in the kingdom of God. I
know of no greater reward to strive
for than this, and with all my soul, I
desire to overcome the weaknesses
and imperfections of humanity and at
the last be received into the kingdom of our God. I hope that I may have
strength to do so, and that the same
strength may be given to the Saints of
God and that the kingdom of God may
come on the earth and His will be
done here as it is done in heaven; all
of which I pray for in the name of
Jesus. Amen.
