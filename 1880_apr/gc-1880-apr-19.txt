PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOE.
I do not know whether we fully understand what is meant by holding up
our hands to testify that we will sustain these missionaries. I will tell you how
I understand it. In the first place we select the very best men we can find,
and we do not want anybody to go but those who have the spirit of their mission upon them, and who feel a desire to magnify their calling and priesthood.
And when they go, we wish them to go as honorable men, and we also want
their wives to be treated as honorable women while their husbands are gone,
and inasmuch as they or their families need assistance or looking after—although it is not all who do—we expect the Presidents of Stakes and the
Bishops will attend to such matters; that the wives of our missionaries may
not feel as though they were outcasts ; but as honorable women, the wives of
honorable men, and more so than those who are not doing their duty. We
want the missionaries' wives and children made comfortable and taken
care of. The sisters have voted to let us have some of their wheat for the relief of the poor. Then on the other hand, let us do something for them. It
does not matter how much we pray for them, for this is in accordance with our
covenants or voting. Some people would rather pray for them than relieve

them. Prayers are all well enough ; but a little flour, a little pork, a little beef,
sugar, store goods, and temporal comforts are a great deal better than all our
prayers without this material assistance. Let us look after their welfare as we
do after our own families, while their husbands are making a sacrifice in
leaving their families and homes, and God will bless us. "Every one," says
the Lord, "that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life." Let us make the words of the
Lord true. Amen.
