PRESIDENT JOSEPH YOUNG.
He recollected the day when the Church consisted of a mere handful of
people scattered over two or three States of the Union. In traveling to visit
them an Elder was greeted with the sound, " There goes a Mormon!" Now,
from Idaho to Arizona, through hundreds of miles, the settlements of the
Saints extend and the people greet an Elder with joy and friendship. It was
the work of the Lord and caused astonishment. He was the Author of it, and
his hand was over all, guiding the destiny of the greatest, and caring even for
the sparrow. By his Spirit we were guided, and it was to carry the tidings of

his work that we traveled or sent our brethren to the ends of the earth. The
speaker described the condition of the world in regard to religion, referring to
the ignorance and fallacies that prevailed. He portrayed the Spirit of Christ
and its effects upon the human heart, and expressed his full confidence in the
Lord and the triumph of this work. Exhorted both young and old to plant
within their hearts a reservoir of truth, and to live so as to know that God
lives, and that they were accepted of him. Whenever Christian sects had enjoyed a portion of the spirit of truth, and rejected this Gospel when it came to
them, they had lost the measure of the spirit previously bestowed. Those
who had accepted this work received the power of God and a testimony of the
truth and lost the fear of death. He bore testimony that the time was near
when God would shake the earth and all things would tremble, and none but
the righteous could stand. He wanted to know that his brethren and sisters
were taking a course that was pleasing in the sight of God, staying themselves
on the promises of God, training their children—the hope of Israel—in the
fear of the Lord, so that when the terrible things predicted by the Savior and
the prophets take place before their eyes, they may be on the watch tower and
prepared for every emergency.
