ELDER JOHN" VAN"' COTT
Referred to the prophesies concerning the redemption of the remnants of
Jacob, and rejoiced to hear of the work which was being accomplished among
them. While Elder Orson Pratt was speaking, he remembered that he (the
speaker), when a boy of sixteen, had the privilege of witnessing the baptism
of Elder Pratt, and was the only member of the Church now living who witnessed it. It was forty-nine years ago last September. It was some years"
after that he himself was baptized, but at that time he received a witness of
the truth, and it never left him wherever he went. If it were not for that testimony he would not be here this day. It was a similar witness that had induced the Saints from every part of the earth to gather to these mountains.
It was time that we should become united and prepared for those important
events predicted which were near at hand. We should refrain from evil, obtain the power to discern the signs of the times and of the coming of the Son
of Man, cultivate the spirit of meekness, forbearance and long suffering, and
seek to God for wisdom that we might be prepared for the great change that is
to come on the earth.
