THE YEAR OF JUBILEE.
{April 6, 1880.)
God of our Fathers, we, this day
Our voices raise in sacred song,
And in it our glad homage pay— •
This tribute doth to thee belong!
Thine hand has been our staff and stay,
Thy power has lit our darkest day,
And Israel, blind, this day can see
The first glad Year of Jubilee
!
In all the past, Ihy people, thou
Hast led with more than Father's care,
And every trial, then or now,
From foes within or foes elsewhere
Hath testimony brought, as rain
Upon the parched and desert plain
Gives life and gladness, fresh and free,
A sure perennial jubilee!
What more could'st thou for us have done?
What blessing hast thou e'er denied?
In eastern lands thou wert our sun,
As on Ohio's praries wide;
And when Missouri's hate was keen,
When from Far West we fled unseen
We hailed afar the yet to be
—
This blessed Year of Jubilee!
When by the Mississippi's stream,
The Temple lifted high in air,
Beauteous as any poet's dream,
"City of Joseph," wondrous fair;
Thou did'st thy people succor then
When martyred prophets fell, as when
From death thy thousands had to flee
To wait this Year of Jubilee!
Thy people's enemies have met
The fate which prophets did portray,
Their sun in darkness quickly set
And with it all their jocund day;
Nq more to them thy Saints shall bow,
No more receive their ready blow.
This is our triumph, surely we
Enjoy our Year of Jubilee!
Here, 'mid the mountains peace hath dwelt;
"Rest for the weary" hath been found;
Here many a bursting heart hath felt
Far from the hated war cry's sound,
As 'twere a heaven already won
'Neath the unclouded western sun.
These had no need to wait for Thee,
In peace they had their Jubilee!
Oh swelling hearts! A cup run o'er,
With mercies, blessings, is your lot;
And there's "a fulness" yet in store,
In heaven the Saints are unforgot.
Promise and prophecy entwined,
In sacred record is enshrined,
These every hour fulfilled to thee,
O Israel, is a Jubilee!
Can Zion's children tell, to-day,
The half of what they now enjoy?
Or can a soul by words portray
What fifty years more will employ
Of inspiration's force and flame?
Or how far lost a foes great name?
Or what the world will surely see
Before next Year of Jubilee?
The Saints will live, the Kingdom grow,
Zion unveiled will "rise and shine!"
Nations and tongues will homage pay
To Truth, of origin divine.
And God will bring to nought each plan
Of false, corrupt, and wicked man.
Who would not wish to live and see
The next glad Year of Jubilee?
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,"
Done, on the earth as 'tis above.
Faith that 'tis nearer with each sun,
Inspired work is a life of love.
Triumph is certain, victory sure;
Blessed are all who will endure.
Time and eternity shall be
To them unending Jubilee!
