ELDER LEVI W. HANCOCK
Said he was seventy-seven years old to-day, and nearly fifty years ago he
was baptized after receiving the testimony of the Prophet Joseph, who received
the word of the Lord and was slain by the professed followers of Him who
died for his fellow man. He was familiarly acquainted with the Prophet,
lived with him for three years, worked under his direction; and he was one of
the most pleasing spirits he had ever been associated with. He then bore
testimony that this gospel was true; the Book of Mormon was true; the
Twelve were true; he heard Joseph say that this work could not be built up
without Twelve Apostles and the Seventies following in their wake. Their decisions, if made in righteousness and unity, were as valid as the decision of
the first presidency in the days of the Prophet, as was declared in the Doctrine
and Covenants, and if there were no divisions among them their voice would
be the voice of the Lord, and all Israel should say amen to it. He exhorted
all the Saints to works of righteousness, and invoked the blessings of God
upon them.
